<h1>The Process</h1>
<h4>My plan begins with the following steps. Finding a place to meet a library. I will also need to raise money to pay for the space, if that is needed. I will need to get the playing materials and dice. That will require raising money to buy the books and materials. I will put up information around town to spread the word. I will also email the people at the library to spread the word around to all the kids and adults that go there. I will need to decide the themes by seeing what the kids like and enjoy. Next, I will need to meet with the kids to talk to them about what D&D is and how you play D&D. Then, I will help the kids make their characters based on what they like and enjoy. Now, the playing begins. Finally, we will meet for about two hours and play D&D. </h4>
