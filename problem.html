  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  <h4>In Birmingham, most kids play video games and don’t interact with their friends and family. They play games on their phones, gaming consoles, computers, I-pads, watches, TVs, virtual reality headsets. A big cause of this is that they can talk to their friends on the game. They can also play with their friends without having to go meet with them. They can also play by themselves and at any time even if it is raining outside. Somethings that happen get on a schedule where you must do every day and if you don’t you are mad and grumpy. They also get addicted to it that they don’t ever go outside to play with their friends. They spend a lot of money on games and things to play on they could be spending that money on things more useful.	</h4>
